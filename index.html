  Hi my name is Timothy i am a sophomore at pasco high school. My goal for this website is to make gaming videos and to post
anything related to gaming. I have a passion for gaming but sports as well. I play sports for my school, the sports i play are
football,soccer, and wrestling. I love to show my pride for my school and my spirit. I named this website <strong>onix gaming</strong> because
  the first ever gaming clan i played for was named that. <br><em>Hope u enjoy this website! </div> <br>
